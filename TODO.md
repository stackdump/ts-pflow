Extract and extend the pflow library from pflow-editor

Perform the traditional tic-tac-toe implementation

WIP
---

- [ ] add some clarification about the differences between guards and inhibitors
- [ ] figure out how to wrap higher level checks around the symbolic guards
- [ ] Use gopflow to generate typescript libs from pflow source files.
- [ ] optimize in-mem storage for state (choose smaller numeric data types if capacity is bounded)
- [ ] ? should we include 'var' bindings ? ie. like pfinance primitives?

- [ ] convert to assemblyscript
- [ ] generate state machine code
